GRAPH A
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6 must be first because it has no dependencies
6 can only lead to points 2, 3, or 7

2 cannot be next because 2 is dependent on 1 being complete
3 cannot be next because 3 is dependent on 2 being complete
7 cannot be next because 7 is dependent on 4 being complete

GRAPH B
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no points without dependencies.
This means there is no point for the sorting to start.
