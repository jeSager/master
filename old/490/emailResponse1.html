	<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#73000A;">Hi!</h1>

	<hr>
	<br>

	<p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">
		We've  done our best to address your concerns below:
	</p>
	<br>

	<ul>
		<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">
		<span style="font-size:130%;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold;">Interface:
		</span>The <a style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#73000A;font-weight:bold;" href="https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php">
			example	instructor interface
		</a> we initially linked you to has buttons. It	sounds like that's what you're describing, but if you have something better, feel free to send it.

				<span style="font-size:130%;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold;"> Batch Uploads:
		</span> If only to assure that there's a 100% stable product at our foundation, it's probably best to agree on a base-level structure for the application.  I like the batch upload concept, but do you think it should be considered base-level? What I'm asking is, should we worry about an instructor interface later, and work on this first?  I'm sure I can find a way to process a file created <a style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#73000A; font-weight:bold;" href="http://www.howtogeek.com/79991/convert-an-excel-spreadsheet-to-a-tab-delimited-text-file/">this</a> way.

	<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size:130%;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold;">Security:  </span>
    Whether you decide on a network application or a web application, there are often predefined functions to work with secure information.  We shouldn't have any trouble keeping either type of application secure.
	</p></li><br>

	<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size:130%;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold;">Security Costs:  </span>
	Although I've found a free web server the team can use for development - one where you can leave the application on as long as you'd like - if you plan to make this a web application you'll need a web host with a trusted name when you plan to make the application live.  If you want a professional, secure website, you will need a <a style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#73000A;font-weight:bold;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" name="private SSL certificate">private
	SSL certificate</a>.  I grabbed some pricing info from <a style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color:#73000A;font-weight:bold;" href="http://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a>, so you'd have a reference point:
	</p>
		<ul><li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">
			$230 total for 3 years including the SSL certificate and the domain name: mathAsks.com
		</p></li></ul>
	</li><br>

	<p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">You can avoid the extra security costs by running the application on the	school network, and as we said before, a web application can run locally, but a desktop application would need to be extended quite a bit to run on the web.  The security risks of limiting a web application to a local network or running a desktop Java application that accesses a network database are virtually the same.  If you want it on the public Internet, though, you'll need to consider the cost of the SSL certificateand hosting.

	<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">
<span style="font-size:130%;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-variant: small-caps; font-weight:bold;">MathJax:  </span>
	 The reason MathJax was mentioned is that it's become the standard.  It's doing this by providing a standard fall-back.  When math fonts don't match in size, it's often the case they've been rendered as an image.  If someone publishes with Microsoft Word, that would be their default.  In contrast, it seems like this is a worst-case scenario when using MathJax.  I've never selected a font with MathJax because the rationale is that MathJax is going to select the best math font for the browser that's viewing the page.  That's its primary job. 	However, there are options to reorder the preferences.  Here's the MathJax native font support list:
	 </p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">MathJax Tex</p></li>
		<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">STIX General</p></li>
		<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">Asana Math</p></li>
		<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">Neo Euler</p></li>
		<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">Gyre Pagella</p></li>
		<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">Gyre Termes</p></li>
		<li><p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">Latin Modern<p></li>
	</ul></li></ul><br>
<p style="font-family:Georgia, serif">I'm not in a position to comment on ownership at the moment, but the team will definitely make it a topic during our next meeting.  Are you available for a Skype meeting this upcoming Tuesday?  We'd like to answer any other questions you have, so we can continue to move forward with your project.  We look forward to seeing the OneNote file with your concept.</p>
